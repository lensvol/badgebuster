Small script to purge cache entries for "badges" in GitHub's README files.

## Why?

GitHub aggressively caches images generated by [shields.io](https://shields.io/) and similar services when you include then
in your repository's Markdown files. This can present a problem if you expect badge image to be changing frequently
(e.g. when underlying data changes). The only reliable way (it seems) to update them is to forcefully bust GitHub badge 
cache using HTTP PURGE request.

## Usage

```bash
./badgebuster.py <GH_USERNAME>/<GH_REPO>
```
